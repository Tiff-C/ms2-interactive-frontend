It’s everything we believe a good hotel should be.\nFirst of all, it’s in Bath – a place so full of heritage and vibrant creative spirit that it is, without doubt, one of Britain’s greatest cities. Then, there’s our location on one of Bath’s grandest streets. And our listed Georgian buildings that carry untold inherent beauty and grace.\n Add to that interior design details and collections of art and objects that steal and entertain the eye. Our bar and restaurant offer something different yet decidedly British. Our spa nurtures real relaxation. And last but not least, our smiling, inspired hosts making sure every guest feels happy and at home.\nWe think we may have created the best reason you could possibly have to immerse yourself in the unique and ripe-for-exploration charms of Bath."

Whether your visit is for business or pleasure, the Sandringham Hotel offers all that the discerning traveller requires and more.\nThe Sandringham Hotel was built in the 1880’s.

Mr. Eric Dutton MBE, a well know figure in the capital, has served as president of Cardiff Chamber of Trade and is a former chairman of Cardiff Initiative. He was also the first-ever patron of the Cardiff Hoteliers’ Association, a position he still holds to this day.

Nowadays, he still runs the hotel along with his sons Simon and Michael and his daughter in law Alison."
